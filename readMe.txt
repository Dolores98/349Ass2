How to run:

Ensure you have downloaded virtual box.
For development, I used version 6.1.

Install Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
for your OS. For development I used version 2.2.10.

Clone the 349Ass1 repository.
CD into the repository in terminal (For Windows users,
use PowerShell).

Enter the command: 'vagrant up'.
If that doesn't work try: 'vagrant up --provider virtualbox'.
